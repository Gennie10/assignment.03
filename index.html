  <h1>The Fountainhead</h1>
  <p>
    “But you see," <b>Roark quietly,</b>  "I have, let’s say, sixty years to live. Most of that time will be spent working. 
    <br>
    I’ve chosen the work I want to do. If I find no joy in it, then I’m only condemning myself to sixty years of torture. <i>And I can find the joy only if I do my work in the best way possible to me.</i> 
    <br>
    But the best is a matter of standards—and I set my own standards. I inherit nothing. <b>I stand at the end of no tradition.</b> I may, perhaps, stand at the beginning of one.”
